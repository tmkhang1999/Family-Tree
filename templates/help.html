                <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                <p>Click the "Create Tree" box in your forest menu and give it a name. From here, you can add members and relations to your tree.</p>
                <p>The interface for editing the tree can be moved around using either the arrow keys or WASD. If you find your tree growing too large for the screen, you can zoom in and out by scrolling.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Editing, saving, deleting, and downloading a Tree</h4>
                <p>Click on any of the trees in your forest to edit them. Once on this page, a save icon at the left of the interface will make sure your work is being stored. If you want to delete a tree, you can do so by selecting the "Delete" option from the dropdown menu of your tree in the forest page. But remember, once it's gone, you can't get it back. If you want a static, image version of your tree to share with others, you can click the download icon at the left of the interface.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Creating, editing and deleting Members</h4>
                <p>Click the "Create Member" button at the left side of the interface. You have to give your member a name, but everything else can be filled in later. When your member is created, it will appear in your tree. It won't be connected to your other members yet, but you can change that by adding a relation.</p>
                <p>Click on your member and its details will pop up to your right. Make any changes you want in these fields and hit save.</p>
                <p>If your member is no longer needed, click on it and hit the delete button in the panel. Any relations connected to your member will disappear with the member, so delete carefully.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Creating, editing and deleting Relations</h4>
                <p>When you have a member selected, click the "Create Relation" button at the left side of the interface. From here, click another member or a relation between two members. When your relation is created, it will appear in your tree as a solid black line, but you can change that later.</p>
                <p>Click on your relation and drag it around until it fits in with the rest of your tree and looks how you want it to. Doing this won't shift existing members and relations, so don't let that stop you while you customize. You can also click on an existing relation and check the box next to "Dotted" for a slightly different look.</p>
                <p>If your relation is no longer needed, click on it and click the delete button in the panel that pops up. The members connected to your relation will go unaffected when you do this, but the line will disappear.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Collaborators</h4>
                <p>If you want some help nurturing your tree, you can add any existing Sapling user as a collaborator! On your forest page, select the "Collaboration" option from the dropdown of the tree you want help with. Listed there will be any existing collaborators. Type the email of an existing Sapling user and hit the "Invite" button to add another. Once your collaborator clicks the link in the invite email, they will have officially accepted the tree into their forest!</p>
			    <p>No matter the tree, only one person can edit at a time. If you click on a tree someone is already editing (even it's a tree you created), you'll get a message that stops you from editing for the time being.</p>
			    <p>Everything to do with a tree (creating, editing, and deleting the tree and its members and relations) is fair game to both you and your collaborators. If you are the collaborator of a tree, it will appear in your forest like any other tree.</p>
                <br>
                
			    <h4>FAQ</h4>
			    <p><strong>Why is nothing showing up when I try to save a new member?</strong> When you make a new member, you have to fill in the name field in order to place it in your tree. All other details are optional, but the name is required for it to appear.</p>
			    <p><strong>Part of my tree is obscured by the header of the page, how do I see the entire thing?</strong> You can zoom in and out by scrolling, or, if you don't want to change the zoom, use the WASD keys to move the canvas around. Another way to view your tree is to download it as an image using the download icon.</p>
			    <p><strong>What does it mean when the email of my collaborator "does not exist in the application"?</strong> This means that the email of the user you've tried to invite does not exist in our database. Once an account is made with that email, you'll be able to invite them. Make sure the email you're using is associated with an exising user!</p>
